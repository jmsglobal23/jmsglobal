    slug: "power-of-fresh-onions",

    content: `
      <p>Fresh onions are a kitchen staple worldwide, celebrated for their versatility, flavor, and nutritional benefits. They belong to the allium family, which includes leeks, garlic, shallots, scallions, and chives, and come in various colors and shapes, such as white, yellow, red, and bulbous forms. These onions are typically grown underground and have a papery outer skin protecting their many layers inside.</p>

      <h3>Nutritional and Health Benefits</h3>
      <p>Onions are rich in antioxidants, vitamins (notably vitamin C), and minerals like potassium. These nutrients contribute to their reputation in folk medicine for soothing ailments such as insect bites, burns, and even bee stings. Including onions in your diet can boost health due to their antioxidant properties and essential nutrients.</p>

      <h3>Flavor Profile and Culinary Uses</h3>
      <p>Raw onions have a crisp texture and a sharp, pungent flavor that adds a savory crunch to sandwiches, salads, tacos, and salsas. They can enhance a dish’s flavor without the need for additional seasoning or salt, making them a popular base ingredient in cooking.</p>
      <p>Cooking onions transforms their flavor dramatically. Slow cooking on low heat for 20 to 30 minutes softens onions, turning them translucent and then caramelizing their natural sugars to produce a sweet, rich taste. Caramelized onions are excellent on pizzas, sandwiches, flatbreads, and pasta. Beyond sautéing, onions can be grilled, steamed, pickled, boiled, fried, roasted, or dehydrated into seasoning powders, showcasing their remarkable versatility.</p>

      <h3>Varieties and Flavor Nuances</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Green onions and chives:</strong> Mild, grassy, and fresh, best used raw.</li>
        <li><strong>Leeks:</strong> Complex and sweet when cooked low and slow, with a buttery texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cippolini and pearl onions:</strong> Mild and sweet, great for stews and pickles.</li>
        <li><strong>White onions:</strong> Mild and clean, ideal raw or softened by soaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow onions:</strong> The workhorse of cooking onions, sharp when raw but sweet and buttery when cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Red onions:</strong> Strong and hot raw, sweet and caramelized when cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Shallots:</strong> Very hot raw but mellow and buttery when cooked.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Soaking raw onions in water for about 15 minutes can reduce their sharp, sulfurous bite, making them milder for salads or sandwiches.</p>
      <p>Onions can stay fresh for weeks when stored in a cool, dry place. Many onions sold in stores are slightly dried to extend their shelf life.</p>
      <p>Onion skins, often discarded, can be repurposed as natural dyes, adding an eco-friendly twist to your kitchen creativity.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In summary, fresh onions are a multi-layered ingredient—nutritionally valuable, flavor-rich, and incredibly versatile. Whether eaten raw for a crisp bite or slow-cooked for sweetness, onions enhance countless dishes and deserve a cherished spot in every kitchen. Experimenting with different varieties and cooking methods can deepen your appreciation for this everyday vegetable’s complex flavors.</p>

    <h2>Why Fresh Drumsticks Matter And Why JMS Global Exporters Is The Right Choice</h2>

    <p>In the world of healthy eating and traditional cooking, fresh drumsticks (also known as moringa pods) have earned a place of honor. Loved for their distinct flavor and praised for their nutritional value, drumsticks are a staple in many cuisines, especially across South Asia and Africa. But as demand grows globally, so does the need for reliable exporters who can deliver quality produce consistently.</p>

    <p>At JMS Global Exporters, we understand that when it comes to fresh vegetables like drumsticks, quality is everything—from how it's grown to how it's packed and shipped.</p>

    <h3>The Nutritional Power of Drumstick</h3>
    <p>Drumsticks are more than just a culinary ingredient. They're packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Rich in vitamin C, calcium, and iron, they support immunity, digestion, and bone health. They're also used in Ayurvedic medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. For health-conscious buyers or food companies, sourcing drumsticks from the right supplier can make a real difference.</p>

    <h3>What Sets Fresh Drumsticks Apart</h3>
    <p>Not all drumsticks are created equal. Freshness affects not only taste and texture but also nutritional value. Drumsticks that are harvested too early or stored improperly lose their potency quickly. That’s why proper handling, storage, and transportation are critical in the export business.</p>

    <h3>Why JMS Global Exporters</h3>
    <p>We’re not just in the business of exporting vegetables—we're in the business of trust.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Stringent Quality Checks:</strong> Each shipment goes through a quality inspection to make sure only the best produce reaches our clients. We pay close attention to size, color, and firmness to meet international standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Freshness You Can Count On:</strong> From the moment the drumsticks are picked, we move fast. Our logistics ensure cold chain management and timely delivery, preserving freshness across borders.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency and Communication:</strong> Whether you're an importer, wholesaler, or distributor, we keep you informed at every step. We believe long-term relationships are built on clear expectations and consistent delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Serving Global Markets</h3>

    title: "Why Are Logistics Rates High in the Export Business",
    author: "JMS Global Exporters",
    slug: "why-logistics-rates-are-high",
    image: Containers1,
    content: `
    <h2>Why Are Logistics Rates High in the Export Business</h2>

    <p>In the world of international trade, logistics plays a crucial role in determining how efficiently goods move from one country to another. For exporters, especially in competitive markets, the cost of logistics can significantly impact profit margins. But one recurring challenge that businesses face is the high logistics rates. Understanding why these costs are elevated is essential for managing budgets, negotiating better rates, and planning effective export strategies.</p>

    <h3>1. Fuel Prices and Energy Costs</h3>
    <p>Fuel is a fundamental component of transportation—whether by sea, air, or land. When global fuel prices rise, shipping companies pass on those additional costs to exporters. Even slight fluctuations can have a ripple effect on freight charges, especially for shipments that require long-haul routes or multiple modes of transport.</p>

    <h3>2. Global Supply Chain Disruptions</h3>
    <p>Events like the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, and port congestion have disrupted global trade routes. These disruptions result in delays, increased container demand, and logistical bottlenecks—all of which contribute to rising rates. Exporters often have to pay premiums for guaranteed space or faster delivery.</p>

    <h3>3. Container Imbalance and Shortages</h3>
    <p>A major factor in rising freight costs is container imbalance. For example, when certain regions import more than they export, containers pile up at destinations and become scarce at origin points. To reposition these containers, shipping companies incur extra costs, which are passed on to customers.</p>

    <h3>4. Port Handling and Terminal Charges</h3>
    <p>Each port has its own set of handling charges, and these have steadily increased due to inflation, labor costs, and investment in infrastructure. Additionally, exporters may face demurrage and detention fees if cargo isn’t cleared within specific time frames, adding to the overall logistics cost.</p>

    <h3>5. Customs and Documentation Complexity</h3>
    <p>Exporting goods across borders requires compliance with a wide range of customs regulations and documentation requirements. Any delays or errors in paperwork can result in penalties, warehousing charges, or shipment re-routing—all of which drive up costs. Hiring experts to manage compliance also adds to operational expenses.</p>

    <h3>6. High Demand for Limited Capacity</h3>
    <p>During peak seasons—such as harvest periods for agricultural products or holiday shopping surges—freight demand skyrockets. Limited vessel and aircraft space leads to bidding wars for available slots. Exporters who want priority treatment must often pay higher rates to secure space.</p>

    <h3>7. Insurance and Risk Management</h3>
    <p>Export shipments face risks like theft, damage, piracy, or loss due to natural disasters. While insurance mitigates these risks, it also adds a layer of cost. High-risk destinations or sensitive goods require higher premiums, contributing to elevated logistics expenses.</p>

    <h3>8. Infrastructure and Connectivity Gaps</h3>
    <p>In some countries, poor road conditions, limited rail networks, or inefficient port infrastructure create logistical hurdles. These inefficiencies increase the time and cost required to transport goods to shipping hubs. Exporters from such regions typically face higher logistics charges compared to those in well-connected markets.</p>

    <h3>9. Currency Exchange Fluctuations</h3>
    <p>Freight rates are often quoted in U.S. dollars, while exporters may operate in different local currencies. Any fluctuation in exchange rates can suddenly make logistics costs more expensive, especially for small and medium enterprises that lack hedging strategies.</p>

    <h3>10. Environmental and Compliance Costs</h3>
    <p>With growing global emphasis on sustainability, many logistics companies are investing in cleaner technologies and greener operations. While beneficial in the long term, these transitions often come with short-term cost increases that affect freight pricing.</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>High logistics rates in the export business are not just a temporary challenge—they reflect a complex web of global economic, infrastructural, and regulatory factors. While exporters cannot control many of these external pressures, understanding them can help in better negotiation, smarter planning, and improved cost efficiency.</p>

    <p>Building strong relationships with logistics partners, investing in supply chain visibility, and keeping up with global trends are all strategic steps exporters can take to stay competitive despite rising logistics costs.</p>

    <h2>Why Fresh Onion Prices Are Low in 2025</h2>

    <p>Explore the reasons behind falling fresh onion prices in 2025 and learn why JMS Global Exporters is a trusted bulk supplier.</p>

    <p>Fresh onions are an essential ingredient in kitchens worldwide, but recent market trends have surprised many. Prices of fresh onions have dropped noticeably in 2025, leaving both farmers and traders wondering what’s behind the dip. In this blog, we’ll break down the key factors causing this price shift and explain why JMS Global Exporters is still a leading name when it comes to reliable bulk supply.</p>

    <h3>1. High Yield in Onion-Producing States</h3>
    <p>One of the primary reasons for the current price drop is a bumper crop across major onion-growing regions, particularly in India. States like Maharashtra and Gujarat reported higher-than-average yields due to favorable weather conditions, leading to increased supply in the domestic and export markets.</p>

    <h3>2. Slower Demand from International Buyers</h3>
    <p>While production is up, demand from international markets has slightly slowed. Some importing countries have temporarily adjusted their buying volumes due to surplus stocks or currency fluctuations, which impacts the export value chain and local pricing.</p>

    <h3>3. Improved Storage and Supply Chain</h3>
    <p>Advancements in cold storage and logistics have improved shelf life and reduced wastage. While this is great for maintaining quality, it also means onions remain in the market longer—adding to the surplus and influencing the price curve.</p>

    <h3>4. Government Export Policies and Tariff Adjustments</h3>
    <p>In some regions, temporary export restrictions or tariff revisions have affected onion trade dynamics. These measures, often intended to protect local markets or stabilize inflation, inadvertently lead to excess supply and suppressed prices in the short term.</p>

    <h3>Why JMS Global Exporters Remains a Trusted Bulk Supplier of Fresh Onions</h3>
    <p>Even in a fluctuating market, <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong> continues to meet global demand for quality fresh onions. Here’s what sets us apart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reliable Sourcing:</strong> We work directly with farms across India, ensuring a steady and scalable supply even during peak seasons or price volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Every shipment undergoes strict quality checks to meet international standards, including size, freshness, and hygiene protocols.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible Bulk Orders:</strong> Whether you need 20 tons or 200, we cater to wholesalers, distributors, and retailers with tailored solutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficient Export Logistics:</strong> With expertise in international shipping and customs, we ensure timely deliveries to ports across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>While fresh onion prices are currently low due to a combination of high production and shifting global demand, this presents a golden opportunity for bulk buyers. With JMS Global Exporters, importers can take advantage of these price trends without compromising on quality or reliability.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a consistent partner in the fresh produce trade—especially onions—<strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong> is ready to fulfill your bulk orders with trust and transparency.</p>

    <h2>The Rising Demand for Frozen Fruits in Global Markets</h2>

    <p>In recent years, frozen fruits have quietly transformed the global food landscape. As consumers become increasingly health-conscious and food companies look for long-lasting, nutrient-preserving options, frozen fruits have carved a prominent niche in kitchens, cafes, and food industries around the world.</p>

    <h3>Why Frozen Fruits Are Gaining Popularity</h3>
    <p>The idea that fresh is always best is being re-evaluated, especially in regions where access to fresh, high-quality produce is seasonal or inconsistent. Frozen fruits, often picked at peak ripeness and flash-frozen within hours, retain most of their vitamins, minerals, and flavor. This makes them not only convenient but also nutritionally reliable.</p>

    <p>From smoothies and desserts to sauces and snacks, frozen fruits offer consistent quality and year-round availability, making them indispensable for foodservice providers and home kitchens alike.</p>

    <h3>The Global Shift Toward Sustainable and Convenient Food</h3>
    <p>Consumers in North America, Europe, and Asia are increasingly prioritizing sustainable and waste-reducing food options. Frozen fruits help minimize food waste, as they last significantly longer than fresh produce. Retailers, too, benefit from reduced spoilage and better inventory control.</p>

    <p>With the rise of plant-based diets and clean-label eating, frozen fruits are meeting demand not just for health benefits, but also for traceable, ethically-sourced produce.</p>

    <h3>Why Quality and Reliability Matter</h3>
    <p>In the global supply chain, consistency and safety are crucial. Exporters who deliver properly processed, hygienically packed frozen fruits stand out. Buyers—especially importers and distributors—seek partners who ensure food safety certifications, clear labeling, and customized packaging to suit their market standards.</p>

    <p>This is where <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong> plays a vital role.</p>

    <h3>Why Choose JMS Global Exporters for Frozen Fruits?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Premium Sourcing:</strong> Fresh fruits selected from trusted farms across India.</li>
      <li><strong>State-of-the-Art Processing:</strong> Advanced freezing and packaging techniques to lock in nutrition and flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Chain Integrity:</strong> Temperature-controlled systems to ensure product safety from farm to port.</li>
      <li><strong>Customized Packaging:</strong> Tailored solutions for importers, distributors, and retail brands.</li>
      <li><strong>Reliable Global Supply:</strong> Consistent year-round availability at competitive pricing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The global market for frozen fruits is expanding rapidly, fueled by shifting consumer habits, food security, and sustainability needs. As demand grows, businesses that prioritize quality and customer satisfaction, like <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong>, are helping to shape the future of frozen food trade.</p>

    <h2>Global Trends in Fresh Vegetable Exports</h2>
    <p>The global demand for fresh vegetables continues to rise, and 2025 marks a pivotal year for suppliers. Buyers today seek more than just competitive pricing—they demand <strong>reliability, quality, compliance, transparency, and sustainability</strong>. At <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong>, we’ve embraced these expectations, adapting our processes to exceed global standards.</p>

    <h3>1. Quality and Food Safety</h3>
    <p>International buyers require suppliers to follow global certifications such as <strong>Global GAP, HACCP, ISO 22000, and FSSAI</strong>. JMS ensures GAP-certified farming, HACCP- and ISO-compliant packing, and multiple quality checks at every stage.</p>

    <h3>2. Traceability and Transparency</h3>
    <p>2025 buyers expect farm-to-fork traceability. At JMS, every shipment carries a unique batch code linked to its origin farm, with digital records accessible to importers for full transparency.</p>

    <h3>3. Freshness with Cold Chain Logistics</h3>
    <p>Maintaining freshness is non-negotiable. JMS employs <strong>refrigerated trucks, pre-cooling, humidity-controlled packaging,</strong> and real-time temperature logs to safeguard quality throughout transit.</p>

    <h3>4. Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Packaging</h3>
    <p>Buyers prefer minimal plastic, recyclable packaging, and eco-friendly farming. JMS delivers through <strong>corrugated recyclable boxes, integrated pest management (IPM), organic practices,</strong> and water-efficient farming techniques.</p>

    <h3>5. Custom Packaging & Private Label</h3>
    <p>Retailers and distributors demand <strong>custom packaging</strong>—from branded boxes to multilingual labels. JMS supports private labeling with flexible options tailored to importer requirements.</p>

    <h3>6. Fast & Clear Communication</h3>
    <p>JMS maintains 24/7 communication via WhatsApp and email, offering real-time shipment updates and rapid problem-solving. Importers trust our proactive and responsive approach.</p>

    <h3>7. Market-Specific Expertise</h3>
    <p>Different regions have unique preferences. With experience across the <strong>UAE, Saudi Arabia, UK, Oman, and Bangladesh</strong>, JMS customizes produce size, grading, and harvesting schedules per market demand.</p>

    <h3>8. Testimonials from Buyers</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Over 5 years of <strong>export experience</strong></li>
      <li>Certified compliance with <strong>Global GAP, HACCP, ISO, FSSAI</strong></li>
      <li>Full <strong>cold chain infrastructure</strong></li>

      <li><strong>Eco-friendly farming & packaging</strong></li>
      <li>24/7 <strong>communication & support</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cold Chain Excellence: How JMS Global Exporters Maintains Freshness In Global Fruit And Vegetable Exports</h2>

    <h3>How JMS Global Exporters Ensures Cold Chain Integrity for Fresh Fruits & Vegetables Exports</h3>
    <p>In the competitive world of global agriculture exports, one critical factor sets leading exporters apart: <strong>cold chain integrity</strong>. When it comes to delivering <strong>fresh fruits and vegetables from India to international buyers</strong>, maintaining product freshness from farm to destination is not just important — it's essential.</p>
    <p>At <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong>, we have built a reputation around this promise. We ensure that every shipment — whether it's <strong>fresh onions, green chillies, bananas, pomegranates, or drumsticks</strong> — retains its freshness, aroma, color, and nutritional value from the moment it is harvested until it reaches the buyer's doorstep.</p>
    <p>In this blog, we take you through how JMS Global Exporters leads with unmatched cold chain practices, and why <strong>global buyers trust us</strong> for quality and consistency.</p>

    <h3>Why Cold Chain Integrity Matters in Exporting Fresh Produce</h3>
    <p>When fruits and vegetables are exported, they travel thousands of kilometers across diverse climates and borders. Any break in temperature-controlled handling during this journey can result in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of freshness</li>
      <li>Reduced shelf life</li>
      <li>Mold, spoilage, or decay</li>
      <li>Financial losses for the buyer</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Maintaining cold chain integrity</strong> ensures that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The product retains maximum freshness</li>
      <li>The buyer receives superior quality</li>
      <li>End consumers are satisfied</li>
      <li>Compliance with import standards is upheld</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is especially crucial when exporting to markets like the <strong>UK, UAE, Netherlands, Europe, and Southeast Asia</strong>, where buyer expectations and safety regulations are stringent.</p>

    <h3>JMS Global Exporters: Committed to Excellence in Cold Chain</h3>
    <p>Our commitment to cold chain management is rooted in three core values:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quality without compromise</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Transparency in operations</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Consistency in global delivery</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here's how we ensure cold chain integrity at every stage:</p>

    <h3>Harvest Timing and Pre-Cooling at the Source</h3>
    <p>We work directly with trusted farmers and harvesting teams who understand the importance of <strong>timing</strong>. All produce is harvested:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At optimal maturity</li>
      <li>During the coolest part of the day (typically early morning)</li>
      <li>With immediate pre-cooling at the collection centers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This step is crucial. It rapidly removes field heat and reduces the risk of spoilage. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green chillies and pomegranates</strong> are pre-cooled to 8°C</li>
      <li><strong>Bananas and onions</strong> are cooled between 10°C and 13°C</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This first step sets the tone for quality all the way to the buyer.</p>

    <h3>Temperature-Controlled Sorting and Grading Facilities</h3>
    <p>At JMS Global Exporters, we sort, grade, and pack the fresh produce in <strong>fully temperature-regulated environments</strong>. Our packing facilities are equipped with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hygienic stainless steel equipment</li>
      <li>Ambient cooling to prevent moisture buildup</li>
      <li>Zero human contamination handling methods</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use <strong>multi-layer breathable packaging materials</strong> that prevent sweating during transit — a crucial point many exporters overlook.</p>

    <h3>Cold Storage Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>modern cold storage units</strong> at our logistics hub. These units are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Equipped with humidity control systems</li>
      <li>Segmented by produce type (fruits vs. vegetables)</li>
      <li>Continuously monitored with digital temperature logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This allows us to safely store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fresh bananas between 13°C and 15°C</li>
      <li>Onions in ventilated units with moisture control</li>
      <li>Pomegranates and chillies at stable 8°C to 10°C</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there's a delay in customs or transport, our storage ensures that freshness remains intact.</p>

    <h3>Reefer Trucks for Inland Transportation</h3>
    <p>From our facility to ports like <strong>Nhava Sheva (JNPT)</strong> or <strong>Mundra</strong>, we transport goods in <strong>reefer trucks (refrigerated trucks)</strong>. These trucks have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time GPS tracking</li>
      <li>Sealed chambers with dual-temperature zones</li>
      <li>24/7 temperature monitoring alerts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not compromise with normal trucks or open transportation methods. Every step is temperature-controlled to ensure top-tier product condition.</p>

    <h3>Reefer Containers for Sea Exports</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>refrigerated containers</strong> from world-class logistics partners for international sea shipments. These containers offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uniform airflow circulation</li>
      <li>Humidity regulation</li>
      <li>Pre-trip inspection certification (PTI)</li>
      <li>Multi-point temperature checks before, during, and after shipping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether a container is headed to <strong>Rotterdam, Dubai, or London</strong>, JMS ensures that it meets <strong>cold chain certification standards</strong> for every destination country.</p>

    <h3>Real-Time Temperature & GPS Monitoring</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>real-time IoT-based sensors</strong> in our shipments. These devices track:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internal container temperature</li>
      <li>Humidity levels</li>
      <li>GPS movement of the shipment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clients can access these records post-delivery as proof of cold chain compliance. Transparency builds long-term trust — and that's the JMS difference.</p>

    <h3>Certifications and Compliance</h3>
    <p>JMS Global Exporters holds certifications that meet international cold chain and food safety requirements, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>APEDA Registration</li>
      <li>FSSAI License</li>
      <li>Global GAP (through partner farms)</li>
      <li>HACCP-based practices in our pack houses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These certifications are a reassurance to buyers that we operate at the highest export standards.</p>

    <h2>From Indian Farms to Global Forks: Trusted Fresh Produce by JMS Global Exporters</h2>

    <h3>Introduction: A Story Rooted in Indian Soil</h3>
    <p>In the heart of India’s fertile farmlands, a quiet revolution is underway. <strong>JMS Global Exporters</strong> bridges the gap between Indian farmers and global markets, delivering <strong>premium-quality fruits and vegetables</strong> to tables across the UAE, UK, Russia, and beyond. Our mission is clear: to bring the freshest produce from Indian farms to global forks, with trust, quality, and care at every step.</p>
    <p>This is more than trade—it’s a farm-to-fork journey built on excellence.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 1: Where It All Begins – The Indian Farms</h3>
    <p>Our journey starts in India’s agricultural heartlands, like <strong>Rasalgaon and Pimpalgaon</strong> in Nashik, Maharashtra, renowned for their export-quality onions, bananas, and pomegranates. JMS partners with farmers who uphold:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sustainable Farming:</strong> Residue-free cultivation with natural fertilizers.</li>
      <li><strong>Clean Irrigation:</strong> Monitored water sources for hygiene.</li>
      <li><strong>Soil Health:</strong> Regular testing to maintain nutrient-rich soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Farmer Training:</strong> Seasonal workshops by agronomists to ensure consistent quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter 2: The Harvest – Picking Perfection</h3>
    <p>Timing is critical. At JMS, we harvest produce at its peak to ensure quality and shelf life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Onions:</strong> Harvested with optimal moisture for extended storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Picked at 75% maturity for perfect ripening during transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Pomegranates:</strong> Selected for size, color, and sweetness.</li>
      <li><strong>Green Chilies:</strong> Hand-picked for crispness and heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Drumsticks:</strong> Harvested at ideal tenderness for nutrient retention.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every batch undergoes rigorous pre- and post-harvest checks to meet global standards.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 3: Sorting, Grading & Packing – Precision Meets Hygiene</h3>
    <p>Once harvested, our produce is processed in <strong>state-of-the-art facilities</strong> with a focus on cleanliness and precision:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Washing:</strong> RO-treated water to ensure hygiene.</li>
      <li><strong>Grading:</strong> Sorted by size, weight, and skin quality (e.g., 50+, 55+, 60+ mm onions).</li>

    <h3>RBSM Mumbai 2025: A Platform for Global Trade</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Reverse Buyer Seller Meet (RBSM) Mumbai 2025</strong>, held on July 21, 2025, brought together global importers from countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Azerbaijan. Organized to promote Indian agricultural exports, the event provided JMS Global Exporters an opportunity to showcase its premium produce, including <strong>bananas, onions, pomegranates, green chilies, and tomatoes</strong>, and connect directly with international buyers.</p>

    <h3>Key Meeting with Azerbaijan Buyer</h3>
    <p>During RBSM Mumbai 2025, <strong>Mr. Mohammad Junaid Shaikh</strong>, founder of JMS Global Exporters, held a strategic discussion with a prominent Azerbaijan buyer.

    <h2>Golden Sweetness from India – The Untapped Potential of Jaggery Exports in 2025</h2>
    <p>In the growing world of natural sweeteners, jaggery is quietly becoming a star product for international buyers. This age-old Indian sweetener is finding its way into kitchens, wellness brands, and retail stores across the globe. And the best part? India holds the largest share of global jaggery production, making it a natural leader in exports.</p>
    <p>At JMS Global Exporters, we’ve recognized this trend early and have dedicated our expertise to delivering top-quality jaggery to global clients who demand purity, consistency, and transparency.</p>

    <h3>What is Jaggery and Why is it in Demand?</h3>
    <p>Jaggery (locally known as Gur) is an unrefined sugar made primarily from sugarcane or palm sap. Unlike white sugar, jaggery retains essential minerals such as iron, magnesium, and potassium. With no chemical processing, jaggery offers a clean, natural sweetener perfect for modern food habits.</p>
    <p>Here’s why jaggery is attracting global buyers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Natural, chemical-free sweetener</li>
      <li>Rich in iron, good for anemia</li>
      <li>Used in Ayurvedic medicines and herbal teas</li>
      <li>High demand among vegans and health-conscious customers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Countries like UAE, UK, USA, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Qatar, and Netherlands are increasing their imports of Indian jaggery, not just for ethnic communities but also for wellness brands and organic food retailers.</p>

    <h3>India – The Home of Premium Jaggery</h3>
    <p>India contributes more than 70% of the world’s jaggery. The diverse climate and rich farming regions of India allow the production of multiple jaggery varieties – from golden blocks to powdered forms and even flavored jaggery.</p>
    <p>At JMS Global Exporters, we work directly with certified farmers and jaggery makers in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu to source pure, export-grade jaggery.</p>

    <h3>Types of Jaggery We Export</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jaggery Blocks (Solid Golden Brown)</li>
      <li>Jaggery Powder (Fine Ground)</li>
      <li>Jaggery Cubes (Portion-Controlled)</li>
      <li>Flavored Jaggery (Ginger, Cardamom, Fennel)</li>
      <li>Palm Jaggery (Karupatti – popular in South India and UAE)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All our jaggery products are certified by FSSAI and APEDA. We ensure they meet all international food safety and packaging standards.</p>

    <h3>2025 Market Trends – Why Global Demand is Rising</h3>
    <p>The global shift towards natural, clean-label products is creating a solid platform for jaggery. As people avoid refined sugar, jaggery is being used in baking, cooking, health supplements, and organic teas.</p>
    <p>Recent trends show:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More international buyers looking for natural alternatives to sugar</li>
      <li>Indian restaurants and sweet manufacturers abroad demanding bulk jaggery</li>
      <li>Ayurvedic brands using jaggery as a base for herbal remedies</li>
      <li>Vegan and organic product brands sourcing jaggery in bulk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At JMS, we’ve seen a 40% increase in jaggery inquiries from UAE, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions since 2023. The market for palm jaggery is also expanding, especially in health stores.</p>

    <h3>How JMS Global Exporters Supports International Buyers</h3>
    <p>We understand the needs of global clients – quality, hygiene, competitive pricing, timely shipment, and reliable packaging. Our process is built around that.</p>
    <p>We follow a buyer-first approach with flexibility in packaging and logistics.</p>
    <p>All our jaggery is tested for color, taste, and shelf-life before shipment.</p>
